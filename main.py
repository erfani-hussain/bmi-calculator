# ğŸš¨ This program interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# inputs
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55: "))

# operation ğŸ‘‡
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
bmi = (weight / (height ** 2))
